    <h1>Welcome to my Collection Game Website</h1>

    <p>This is a game that I created using Construct with help from multiple video tutorials, and is one of my favorite games so far. There are multiple aspects within this game which were not present in previous games which make the game exponentially better in my opinion, and I hope you enjoy it! </p>
