    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <p style="font-style:oblique""font-size:24px">To play the game, you control your character (which totally isn't an exact pixel by pixel replica of Mega Man) with the mouse, and your goal is to collect the green coins, which add to your point total, or collect a few different power-ups which either make you invincible or destroy nearby enemies. The enemies are the sharp objects and the power-ups are a yellow coin and a bomb. I wish you good luck is you want to have any hope of getting more than 500 points!</p>
