    <h1>Layout</h1>

    <p>The game's layout involves a feew different sprites, along with text that sometimes fades in and out. As previously stated, you control "Totally not Mega-Man" and try to collect points and power-ups, all while voiding the moving knifes and saws which are activelly trying to reduce your HP. You start with 5 health, which goes down by 1 with each hit. You gain 1 point from every green coin, and 5 for the yellow coin and the bomb. Besides the point and health counters, the background displays text which instructs you on what you must do in the game as well as "Game Over" if you lose all of your HP.</p>
